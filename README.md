# etch-a-sketch
Will be creating a etch-a-sketch/sketchpad. The project will consist of having a 16x16 adjustable grid platform that the user can color by selecting one of many selections. The default selection is black, however the user can change the color using a color selector, rainbow, gray scale, and more. The user can also change the grid size from 2x2 up to 64x64. Lastly, there will be an eraser and a clear table.

Now that the Etch-Sketch is completed I have changed it so that the default grid size is 32x32, default background is black, and the user has access to toggle buttons such as; grayscale, rainbow (random RGB values on every new div), brush selection, background section, and board clear. This project has allowed me to further my knowledge with DOM manipulation, looping through multiple divs, diffrent inputs/event handlers.
One thing I've noticed is this project has many divs when the selected grid value around/above 32x32. Hence, there is thousands of elements in the index causing possible issues for people with slower computers based on my light-house results. Although this isn't an issue for me and the project wasn't meant to be complete in that sense of aproach. It did however teach me, to keep the number elements in a web-page to more of a minimum.
